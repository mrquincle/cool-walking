# Comparison different MCMC methods

Cool Walking and methods like J-Walking, S-Walking, Smart Darting, and Parallel Tempering are compared in [1]. In this repository we do not a full comparison (yet), but compare it with a new MCMC approach in which we do not used chains on different temperatures, but pick from a set of (symmetric) proposal distributions.
